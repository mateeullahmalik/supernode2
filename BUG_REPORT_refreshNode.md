# Bug Report: Critical ID Comparison Mismatch in refreshNode

## Summary
The `refreshNode` function in `p2p/kademlia/hashtable.go` has a critical bug where it compares raw node IDs against hashed IDs, causing the comparison to always fail. This results in unintended rotation of bucket entries and corruption of the LRU (Least Recently Used) ordering in Kademlia routing tables.

## Severity
**HIGH** - Silent data corruption with potential for runtime panics

## Affected Components
- `p2p/kademlia/hashtable.go`: `refreshNode()` function (lines 89-113)
- `p2p/kademlia/dht.go`: `addNode()` function (caller at line 1276)

## Bug Description

### Root Cause
The `refreshNode` function is designed to move a node to the end of its bucket (marking it as most recently seen). However:

1. **Called with hashed ID**: `refreshNode` is invoked with `node.HashedID` from `DHT.addNode()` at line 1276
2. **Compares against raw ID**: Inside `refreshNode`, the comparison uses `bytes.Equal(v.ID, id)` at line 102
3. **Comparison always fails**: Since `v.ID` is the raw node ID and `id` is the hashed ID, they will never match

### Code Analysis

#### Problematic Call Chain:
```go
// In DHT.addNode() at dht.go:1275-1276
if s.ht.hasBucketNode(index, node.ID) {        // Check uses raw ID
    s.ht.refreshNode(node.HashedID)             // But passes hashed ID
    return nil
}
```

#### Buggy Implementation (BEFORE FIX):
```go
// In refreshNode() at hashtable.go:101-106
for i, vためrange bucket {
    if bytes.Equal(v.ID, id) {  // BUG: Comparing raw ID with hashed ID
        offset = i
        break
    }
}
```

## Impact Analysis

### Immediate Effects
1. **Unintended Rotation**: When the node isn't found (always), `offset` remains 0, causing `bucket[0]` to be rotated to the end
2. **LRU Corruption**: The least recently seen node (bucket[0]) is incorrectly marked as most recently seen
3. **Potential Panic**: If bucket is empty, accessing `bucket[0]` causes index out of range panic

### Long-term Consequences
1. **Degraded Routing Performance**: 
   - Incorrect eviction of active nodes when buckets are full
   - Retention of stale nodes that should have been evicted
   - Increased hop count for DHT lookups

2. **Silent Performance Degradation**:
   - Accumulating corruption with each `refreshNode` call
   - Essentially random LRU ordering after sufficient operations
   - More severe impact on long-running nodes

3. **Network Efficiency Loss**:
   - Higher latency for DHT operations
   - Increased network traffic due to suboptimal routing
   - Reduced overall DHT reliability

### Why Tests May Still Pass
- Basic store/retrieve functionality remains intact (nodes are still in buckets)
- `closestContacts` doesn't rely on LRU ordering
- Performance degradation is gradual and might not trigger test failures
- Short-lived test environments don't accumulate enough corruption

## Fix Applied

### Solution
Changed the comparison to use hashed IDs and added safety check:

```go
// Fixed implementation in hashtable.go:89-122
func (ht *HashTable) refreshNode(id []byte) {
    ht.mutex.Lock()
    defer ht.mutex.Unlock()

    index := ht.bucketIndex(ht.self.HashedID, id)
    bucket := ht.routeTable[index]

    var offset int
    found := false
    for i, v := range bucket {
        // FIX: Compare hashed IDs since refreshNode is called with HashedID
        if bytes.Equal(v.HashedID, id) {
            offset = i
            found = true
            break
        }
    }

    // Safety check: only rotate if node was actually found
    if !found {
        return
    }

    // Move node to end (most recently seen)
    current := bucket[offset]
    bucket = append(bucket[:offset], bucket[offset+1:]...)
    bucket = append(bucket, current)
    ht.routeTable[index] = bucket
}
```

### Key Changes
1. **Line 104**: Changed comparison from `v.ID` to `v.HashedID`
2. **Lines 100, 106, 112-115**: Added `found` flag and safety check to prevent rotation when node isn't in bucket

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
1. Test `refreshNode` with both existing and non-existing nodes
2. Verify correct LRU ordering after refresh operations
3. Test with empty buckets to ensure no panics

### Integration Tests
1. Monitor bucket ordering during extended DHT operations
2. Measure lookup performance metrics before/after fix
3. Stress test with rapid node additions and refreshes

### Performance Metrics to Monitor
- Average hop count for lookups
- Node eviction patterns
- Routing table stability over time
- DHT operation latency

## Prevention
1. Ensure consistent ID type usage (raw vs hashed) across function boundaries
2. Add type safety or documentation to clarify expected ID formats
3. Consider using typed IDs to prevent mixing raw and hashed values
4. Add assertions or validation in critical path functions
